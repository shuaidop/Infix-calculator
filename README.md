# Infix-calculator
The interface and classes using by infix calculator are all created in this project

To using the infix-calculator, user should enter the number and operator in the “enter.txt” file 

BE AWARE OF YOU MUST ENTER A SPACE BETWEEN THE OPERATOR AND OPERANDS

The calculator can calculate + - * / ( ) < > ! | & and also ^ tan() sin() cos() %
For the last five operators are extra credit for the project.
After entering the function then run the program “ReadWriteText”, the output will write in the “output.txt” fie automatically .



**when the item enter is not a number the program will try null pointer exception 
**when the file is not read, the program catch the FileNotFoundException

REMINDER  
**************
The output.txt file is the file to hold the output when ruingn the ReadWriteText class, but the outputPJT is the file to includes author information at the beginning and shows the compile and run steps of the code. The best way to generate this file is to cut and paste from the command line.
